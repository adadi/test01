Hello,

[Insert error details here]

I have spoken with Antoine Polfliet, who has already updated Apache. He advised me to check our Apache deployment playbook. He suggests adding the following line in the httpd.conf file:

LoadModule ssl_module module/mod.so

Also, we need to update the Apache path to:

/data/occpre/apache/apacheCore

Please consider these modifications and apply them as soon as possible.

Best Regards,
[Your name]
