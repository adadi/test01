Subject: Urgency: Security Vulnerability Detected in Apache 2.4.49 - Upgrade Required

Hello,

The ISAP-ITS-DSS-VMS team has detected a significant security vulnerability in the current version of Apache (2.4.49) that we are using on our development, production, and pre-production servers.

For security reasons, we need to upgrade to the latest version of Apache as soon as possible. This is a high-priority task that must be resolved immediately to avoid any potential risk.

I am not certain of the team that will be responsible for this upgrade. Could you please identify the appropriate individuals and alert them to this situation? I can create a support ticket regarding this issue if needed.

Thank you in advance for your prompt cooperation on this matter.

Best regards,
[Your nam
