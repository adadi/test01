Summary:
“Authentication failure causing project build error and blocking work.”

Description:
“We are encountering a recurrent problem which is impacting our operations. Previously, we could successfully build the ‘oneclick-internet-back’ project. However, recently we have been receiving an error: ‘Failed to execute goal on project oneclick-internet-back: Could not resolve dependencies…’ This issue seems to be caused by an authentication failure when trying to access ‘calinex.ca.cib:8443’ using the ‘srv_occ_dev@emea.cib’ account. Notably, this was working perfectly a week ago when accessing ‘cib-occ-maven-releases/onclick-model’ version ‘dev.21e0e4e9’. But now, we intermittently cannot access ‘calinex.ca.cib:8443’, causing our work to be blocked. We urgently need assistance in resolving this issue.
