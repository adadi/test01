Subject: Issue with Keycloak for Project AROMA - Request for log files

Hello ITS team,

I am encountering an issue with Keycloak on the preproduction environment for the AROMA project. To help me troubleshoot, could you please send me the latest Keycloak log files from the servers uqvpaap00000049 (Clichy) and uqvpaap0000004a (Marcoussis)?

The files should be located in the following directory: /data/PIC/Softs/keycloak/jboss-eap-7.1/standalone/log.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
